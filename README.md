# AI Jewellery Analyser

## Overview
This open source project uses OpenAI 4o API and Streamlit to analyze jewellery images, predicting the type and relevant details. Originally developed for a demo of the Jewellery Inventory Management System, this repository is now publicly available for community contributions.

## Features
- Image recognition for different jewellery types.
- Extensible model architecture for continuous improvement.
- Easy setup with Python and Streamlit.

## Installation
1. [Create your Python environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
2. Activate the environment.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> `streamlit run main.py`

> Any jewellery image can be uploaded and the model will predict the jewellery type and related details

## Usage
1. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```
2. Upload a jewellery image.
3. View the predicted jewellery type and details.
